# <p style="color:#e57373">Object Oriented Programming <strong>Notes</</p>

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Abstraction</b> :** Representation of complexity. 
 _Eg. when you represent the cars property and behavior. The car has property of color, brand and type. It has a behavior of accelarating and breaking_


- **<b style="color:#e57373"> Classes</b> :** The classes that holds the variables / property and method / behaviour.

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Objects </b>:** When Instantiating the class it becomes object.

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Inheritance:** Is when you extends the class

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Polymorphism</b>:** Is when solving 1 problem but with different approaches. _Eg. you have a smartphone for communication. The communication mode you choose could be anything. It can be a call, a text message, a picture message, mail, etc. So, the goal is common that is communication, but their approach is different. This is called Polymorphism. [source](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html)_


- **<b style="color:#e57373">Encapsulation</b>:** Is a way to privatize the variables and providing access to them in a public method (_Getter and Setter_).  Itâ€™s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide. [source](https://stackify.com/oops-concepts-in-java/)

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Method Overriding </b>:** Is the ability of the child class to override the particular method of the parent class.  [source](https://stackify.com/oops-concepts-in-java/)

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Method Overloading </b>:** Is the same method but performs different action. This will dependend to the arguement pass.  [source](https://stackify.com/oops-concepts-in-java/)

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Static variable or function </b>:** Is shared by all instances of a class. Meaning you can use the property or function without instantiating.  [source](https://www.quora.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-What-is-a-static-method)

- **<b style="color:#e57373">Final Class</b>:** When you don't want other class to extend your class.  


- **<b style="color:#e57373">3 Types/Ways of Accessing variable and method </b>:**
	
	 - **<b style="color:#e57373">1 </b>:**  Instantiating the class and making it object.

	 - **<b style="color:#e57373">2 </b>:**  Within the class itself can access the property and method.

	 - **<b style="color:#e57373">3 </b>:**  When extending the class.



- **<b style="color:#e57373">Public property & method </b>:**  All public variable and method can be accessable anywhere.` Given the 3 type of access. All 3 are possible way to access the property and method of the class. `


- **<b style="color:#e57373">Protected property & method </b>:**  The protected variable or method can only be access within th class or when extending the class.` Given the 3 type of access. 2 and 3 are possible way to access the property and method of the class. `


- **<b style="color:#e57373">Private property & method </b>:**  The Private variable or method can only be access within the class itself. But if you apply encapsulation then you can access the private variables.` Given the 3 type of access. 2 is the only possible way to access the property and method of the class. `
